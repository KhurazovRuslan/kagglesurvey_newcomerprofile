<h1>Kaggle surveys. Beginer's profile.</h1>


This is analysis of 2019 and 2021 Kaggle surveys that's focused on data science and machine learning beginner's profile and how it changed over a 2-year period. This project also tries to answer how owner of the project fits into that profile. Dount charts are chosen as graphs for the project.
